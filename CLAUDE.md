# AI Financial Analyst Agent — CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

Conversational AI Financial Analyst Agent built as a portfolio/prototype project. Uses a ReAct + Multi-Agent architecture with LangGraph. Accepts natural language queries, classifies intent, and routes requests — running a structured multi-agent pipeline for stock analysis or answering general finance questions directly.

**This is not a production system.** It is a hire-worthy portfolio showcase of agentic AI engineering patterns.

## Environment Setup

```bash
conda activate fin-agent        # always activate before working
pip install -e ".[dev]"         # installs project + dev tools editable
cp .env.example .env            # then fill in the 3 API keys
```

### Required API Keys (all free tier)
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` — [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` — [app.tavily.com/sign-in](https://app.tavily.com/sign-in) (1,000 free searches/month)
- `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` — [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com)

Note: LangSmith env vars changed in v0.8 — use `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` and `LANGSMITH_TRACING=true`, not the old `LANGCHAIN_*` names.

## Running the Project

```bash
# Conversational chat UI — Phase 1+ (recommended)
streamlit run ui/chat_app.py

# Classic single-turn form UI
streamlit run ui/app.py

# Demo replay without any API calls (for interviews)
# In the classic UI: check "Dry-run mode" and upload a run_trace.json
```

---

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/unit/          # fast, no API calls — always run these first
pytest tests/integration/   # agent logic with mocked LLM/tools
pytest tests/adversarial/   # security: prompt injection payload detection
pytest tests/e2e/           # full pipeline with pre-recorded mocked responses

# Full suite with coverage
pytest --cov=ai_financial_analyst --cov-report=term-missing
```

All four layers must pass before any feature is complete. Current status: **156/156** (unit + integration + adversarial).

## Architecture

Two-layer system: a conversational agent on top, the analysis pipeline below.

```
User (natural language)
    ↓
ConversationalAgent  ← intent classifier (Flash-Lite)
    ↓ financial_analysis          ↓ financial_question   ↓ off_topic
Orchestrator                 Primary LLM             Rejection template
    ↓
Researcher → Quant Analyst → Editor → Markdown Report
```

## Models

| Model | Use |
|---|---|
| `gemini-3-flash-preview` | Primary ReAct reasoning loop |
| `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` | Sanitizer extraction sub-tasks (optional) |

`max_retries=1` is set on both LLM instances. In `langchain-google-genai` 4.x, `max_retries=0` means "use SDK default (5 retries)" — setting `1` disables the SDK layer so only our `tenacity` circuit-breaker retries.

---

## Critical Design Decisions (Do Not Change Without Review)

### No Python REPL
`CalculatorTool` uses `numexpr` with a three-level AST guard:
1. Node-type whitelist — only arithmetic AST node types
2. Name allowlist (`_SAFE_NAMES`) — blocks `__import__`, `os`, etc.
3. Function allowlist (`_SAFE_FUNCTIONS`) — blocks all calls except `sqrt`, `log`, etc.
4. Constant type check — string/bytes literals rejected

Changing to a general REPL is a security regression.

### Full-Content Injection Rejection
`ContentSanitizer._regex_filter()` rejects the **entire content block** when any injection pattern matches. Sentence-level `[REDACTED]` replacement was insufficient — surrounding context still guided adversarial behaviour. Do not revert to partial stripping.

### Sequential Agent Execution
Agents run one at a time. Do **not** make them concurrent — this saturates the free-tier 15 RPM limit and triggers the circuit breaker.

### `AgentState` Return Pattern
All agent nodes return via `AgentState(**{**state, "key": value, ...})` — **not** `AgentState(**state, key=value)`. TypedDict spreads all keys as kwargs; duplicate keys cause `TypeError: got multiple values for keyword argument`.

### max_iterations = 5
The Researcher agent hard-caps at 5 tool calls per ticker. Increasing this risks exhausting the free-tier RPD limit on multi-ticker runs.

### Tavily over DuckDuckGo
Tavily is LangChain's default search tool, purpose-built for AI agents. `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` is a legacy tool. Google Custom Search API is closed to new signups in 2026. Do not revert.

### ConversationState vs AgentState — Two Separate TypedDicts
`ConversationState` (in `core/conversation_state.py`) is owned by the `ConversationalAgent` and holds chat-level state: messages, session ID, last intent, pending tickers. `AgentState` (in `core/state.py`) is owned by the inner Researcher → Quant → Editor pipeline. They must never be merged — the chat layer is a routing layer, not a pipeline participant. The `ConversationalAgent` calls `run_pipeline()` and receives back the final report; it never reads or writes `AgentState` directly.

### Intent Classification Uses Sub-LLM (Flash-Lite)
The intent classifier in `agents/intent_classifier.py` uses `get_subllm()` (Flash-Lite) rather than the primary LLM (Flash). This preserves the primary model's 15 RPM budget for actual analysis. The classifier is a cheap JSON extraction call — Flash-Lite is sufficient.

### Five-Intent Taxonomy — `memory_query` Is Distinct From `financial_analysis`
The classifier uses five intents: `financial_analysis`, `financial_question`, `memory_query`, `off_topic`, `clarification_needed`. `memory_query` is essential: without it, a message like "What did we find about AAPL earlier?" triggers the full pipeline because it contains a ticker. The classifier prompt includes explicit examples of retrospective phrases ("earlier", "last time", "what did we find") that force `memory_query` even when a ticker is present. Do not merge or remove this intent.

## Free-Tier Limits

| Service | Limit | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `CircuitBreakerError` | 3× 429 within 30s | Wait ~1 min; use `--dry-run` for demo |
| `PartialStateError` | Agent boundary missing required field | Check `iteration_log` in trace for upstream tool failure |
| `SanitizationAlert` | Canary token in agent output | Potential injection — inspect `run_trace.json` |
| `TypeError: got multiple values` | `AgentState(**state, key=val)` pattern | Use `AgentState(**{**state, "key": val})` instead |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY not set` | `.env` not loaded | Run from project root; ensure `python-dotenv` loaded |
